    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This “Tom Cruise Cake,” inspired by the decadent dessert the movie star 
        famously sends as a holiday gift, is as irresistible as it gets. 
        The buttery sour cream pound cake features white chocolate chips 
        and sweetened coconut flakes and is topped with a cream cheese frosting
          — what’s not to love? </p>
