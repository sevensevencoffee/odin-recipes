    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A cobbler — not to be confused with a crisp or crumble 
        — is a deep-dish fruit dessert with a sweetened fruit 
        filling that is topped off with a biscuit-like dough. 
        The dough may cover the entire dish or be dropped by 
        the spoonful, earning it the name "cobbler" for its 
        resemblance to a cobblestone street. It gives you the 
        same fruit-and-pastry combination as pie, but without 
        all the effort.</p>
    
    <p>In the case of peach cobbler, fresh, frozen, or canned 
        peaches may be combined with sugar, spices, lemon juice, 
        and cornstarch (for thickening). As with all cobblers, it's 
        finished off with a biscuit-like topping and sprinkled with 
        a cinnamon-sugar mixture.</p>
